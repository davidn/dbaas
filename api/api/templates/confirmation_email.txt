{% if is_paid %}Here’s important information about your new GenieDB cluster environment.  You’re now deployed on instances distributed across {{ regions }} datacenters.{% else %}You're now set to begin your free 7-day trial of GenieDB. We've created a two node replicating cluster environment, deployed on two small instances distributed across {{ regions }} datacenters. 

Just a reminder that this is basic test environment gives you access to all the cool features of GenieDB but won’t perform under load. Once you're happy with our features and want access to the higher performance environment, we can assist you in setting up a high performance cluster for additional testing.{% endif %}

Here are your connectivity details and some helpful tips to get started:

1. There is a default database '{{db}}' created.
2. To create any table that you want replicated, you must add
   'ENGINE=GenieDB' to the end of the SQL statement.  For example:
      CREATE TABLE {{db}}.foo(a INT PRIMARY KEY, b INT) ENGINE=GenieDB;
3. To create any non-replicated table, you can use ENGINE=MyISAM or ENGINE=InnoDB.
4. For optimal performance you should host your application servers in the regions you chose.
5. The cluster domain name
   {{cluster_dns}}
   will automatically find the nearest database node.
6. The individual nodes can be directly accessed using the node information listed below.
