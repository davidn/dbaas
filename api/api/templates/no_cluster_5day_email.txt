Hi {{username}},

GenieDB is a hosted database-as-a-service (DBaaS) solution that runs on multiple cloud infrastructures and enables cross regional distribution of standard MySQL. GenieDB provides master-master replication (active-active) and synchronization across regions for availability during regional outages and faster app response time to distributed users.  

GenieDB is delivered as a service (DBaaS), so all database management and administration is handled by the expert team at GenieDB so you can focus your efforts on what matters: application development. You simply point your application to the database according to the provided instructions. Once your database cluster has been activated, nodes can be monitored and managed via the GenieDB Cluster Management Tool.
